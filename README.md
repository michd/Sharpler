# Sharpler

Sharpler is my attempt at a music player with just the features I desire of such an application.

These features include:

- Simple transport control (play/pause/stop/next/prev, that stuff)
- Play queue
- Easily searchable media library

There are plenty of other features in my mind, mostly sub-features of the above 3.

I put it up on GitHub the moment I had a simple windows form going where I could select some audio and hit play/pause/stop.

Suffice to say it's nowhere near the intended target in terms of features. Work in Progress, yadda yadda.
